# ML_project
In this project I was testing supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for weather condistions prediction.  
I've treid to run K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) methods.

This repository contains data and Jupyter Notebooks used to prepare and use the weather data for machine learning methods.  
Additionally, I include all the documents from the exercise plus the final presentation.

# Jupyter notebooks

This script is (preparing the data for machine learning)[Exercise_1.2_JKG]
Here a (gradient descdent function)[Exercise_1.3_JKG] was applied to the data
Then (KNN algorithm)[Exercise_1.4_JKG] was performed
Followed by (DT)[Exercise_1.5_DT_JKG] and (ANN)[Exercise_1.5_ANN_JKG] methods
